# gocloud-blob-bucket

This package is a thin wrapper around the [Go Cloud](https://gocloud.dev/howto/blob/) package in order to be able to specify AWS S3 credentials using string values.

## Important

This package has been deprecated and will no longer be updated. The S3 functionality has been moved in to the [go-cloud-s3blob](https://github.com/aaronland/go-cloud-s3blob) package.
